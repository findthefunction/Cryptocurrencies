# Cryptocurrencies

Analyse crypto currency market to group currencies together using a clustering algorithm.  We reduced the principle components usin PCA and processed the data to fit the machine learning models.


  - Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
  - Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
  - Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
  - Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
